Here's how you can confidently promote yourself and your ideas at work.

In my experience, the power of a well-established network cannot be overstated. It's not just about who you know, but who knows you and understands the value you bring. Engage with colleagues across various functions and levels – their support can be pivotal in advancing your initiatives. Remember, a genuine connection is more valuable than a large contact list. Invest time in building trust and understanding, and you'll find your network becomes one of your greatest assets in promoting yourself and your ideas.

Here's how you can confidently promote yourself and your ideas at work.

Persistence is key when promoting yourself and your ideas. Not every suggestion will be embraced immediately, and rejection is part of the journey. However, setbacks should not discourage you. Learn from them, refine your proposals, and try again at the right time. Staying persistent shows your passion for contributing to the company's success and your belief in the value of your ideas. This resilience not only demonstrates your commitment but also helps build credibility and respect among your peers and leaders. Keep pushing forward, and your persistence will pay off.

Here's how you can confidently promote yourself and your ideas at work.

Knowing your worth is essential for promoting yourself. Reflect on your unique skills, experiences, and accomplishments that drive your team's success. This self-awareness boosts your confidence and helps you articulate your contributions effectively. When you understand your value, you can better highlight how your ideas and efforts align with the company's goals, showcasing the tangible value you bring. This not only reinforces your position but also makes it easier for others to recognise and appreciate your contributions, paving the way for career growth and opportunities.

Here's how you can confidently promote yourself and your ideas at work.

Leveraging feedback is crucial for growth. From my journey, I've learned that seeking and acting on feedback is non-negotiable. Gather feedback from colleagues, mentors, and clients to get diverse insights. Approach it with an open mind and listen without getting defensive. Implement changes based on the feedback and monitor the results to show your commitment to improvement. Follow up with those who provided feedback to show appreciation and encourage ongoing input. Foster a feedback-friendly environment to promote continuous improvement. This approach enhances your performance and propels your team towards success​​​​​​.

The Real Deal: My Story from Brick Lane to Dragons' Den
James Caan

After dropping out of school at just sixteen, James Caan started his business life in a broom cupboard with no qualifications and two pieces of fatherly wisdom: 'observe the masses and do the opposite' and 'always look for opportunities where both parties benefit'. Armed with this advice, natural charm and the Yellow Pages, he built a market-leading business with a turnover of £130 million and swiftly became one of Britain's most successful entrepreneurs.

After dropping out of school at just sixteen, James Caan started his business life in a broom cupboard with no qualifications and two pieces of fatherly wisdom: 'observe the masses and do the opposite' and 'always look for opportunities where both parties benefit'. Armed with this advice, natural charm and the Yellow Pages, he built a market-leading business with a turnover of £130 million and swiftly became one of Britain's most successful entrepreneurs.

From Caan's childhood as a Pakistani immigrant to the phenomenal success of his first company and beyond, The Real Deal traces both his financial and personal achievements. It offers a frank account of what success at thirty really signifies and brings us right up to the present, including his impact on Dragons' Den and what his charity work, from saving a hospital in London to building a school in Lahore, means to him. Ultimately, it is a story of learning what money is really worth, told by one the country's most insightful businessmen. Show less

“There are few people in this world, let alone within the recruitment industry who have the gravitas and character of James. His ability to stay close to all of his portfolio businesses and retain detailed complex information is outstanding. He is able to turn on a six-pence; completely dynamic and driven to the core; a drive that makes him thrive time and time again to be the best; and drive those around him to raise their game accordingly. A fantastic period in my career; thank you.”

Sally Hughes

“I worked with James in Alexander Mann Associates some years ago, he taught me an awful lot, he was always customer focused and wanted the best for clients, was never too busy to talk and give some guidance and was always there for you when times go tough and still is I would recommend James and his business to anyone you will always be well looked after and get the best”

In the dynamic terrain of talent acquisition, forging strategic alliances with specialist recruiters can be a game-changer. By tapping into their expertise and networks, we secure a lifeline to pools of highly skilled professionals - a crucial advantage in the quest for future talent. My journey has taught me that the essence of successful sourcing isn't hinged solely on immediate vacancies but on cultivating robust relationships with niche recruitment experts. These alliances are invaluable; they act as conduits to passive candidates, those not actively seeking new roles but who may be the perfect fit for your organisation. Working with specialist recruiters offers a window into industry-specific trends and salary benchmarks, ensuring we offer competitive packages to attract top-tier candidates. This intel is golddust in tailoring our approach and proposition to meet the expectations of high-caliber talent. Another aspect where specialist recruiters shine is in their deep understanding of their candidate base - they know the motivations, career aspirations, and skill sets of their talent pool. This insight ensures that when they recommend a candidate, there's a higher probability of a good cultural and technical match. In a landscape often defined by its agility and competitiveness, the relationships we nurture with specialist recruiters enable us to be proactive rather than reactive in our recruitment strategies. By aligning with these experts, we're not just filling roles; we're future-proofing our organisations, ensuring that we have access to the visionaries and innovators who will drive our businesses forward. In conclusion, as we look beyond the horizon for future talent, our collaboration with specialist recruiters is not just an asset; it's imperative. It's these partnerships that will help us navigate the rapidly evolving job market, ensuring we not only meet but exceed our strategic staffing goals. #TalentAcquisition #RecruitmentStrategies #FutureOfWork

We’ve seen a marked improvement in the market in the last few weeks. And according to the latest KPMG and REC, UK Report on Jobs things continue to improve in the job market. Key Findings: 🔺Fall in permanent hiring the softest in over a year. 🔺May saw a weaker decline in permanent placements. It was the twentieth successive month in which placements have fallen, BUT the latest decline was modest and slowest since March 2023. 🔺A similar trend was seen for temp billings, with the latest contraction the weakest in four months. There were reports that slow decision-making, a lack of vacancies and specific candidate shortages weighed on placements. 🔺Amid reports of a competitive market landscape, alongside evidence of a ripple impact on base pay rates following April’s increases in the national minimum and living wages, typical starting pay for candidates rose again during May. 🔺A further uplift in pay rates. For permanent workers, salaries were reported to have increased markedly and to only a slightly lesser extent than April’s four-month high. Temp staff saw a similar trend, with pay rising at only a slightly slower pace than in the previous month. 🔺Vacancies down slightly. Although demand for staff continued to fall in May, extending the current downturn to seven months, it did so only marginally and to the lowest degree in this sequence. Moreover, the latest fall was exclusively led by permanent workers as temp staff demand was unchanged in the latest survey period. 🔺Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) indicated a drop in the number of vacancies in the three months to April 2024. According to the ONS vacancies fell 26,000 compared to the three months to January, with the overall number of job vacancies dropping to 898,000. Compared to a year ago, vacancies are some 190,000 lower but remain significantly higher than just prior to the start of the pandemic in March 2020 (796,000). 🔺Staff Avaliability Rises. May’s survey revealed another steep increase in staff availability. The rate of growth was the steepest recorded by the survey since December 2020. It was noted that a mixture of redundancies, higher unemployment and reduced demand for staff led to the broad rise in candidate availability. If you'd like to receive a copy of the full report - feel free to comment or send me a DM. Thanks so much as always to Paul Sharpe for sending us this report. Is this reflective of what you are seeing in your market, is the tide finally turning? Keen to hear your thoughts? #rec2rec #recruitment

WHO IS TO BLAME FOR SUCH A NARROW RECRUITMENT FOCUS? FSN contributor Jan Nallathamby ACMA, CGMA, MSc raises the troubling issue of blinkered recruiters and hiring managers, who focus exclusively on replicating what has gone before, rather than lifting their sights beyond immediate track record, roles and job titles. Such an approach undervalues the highly transferrable skills of intelligent and experienced candidates and underserves the ambitions of the hiring company. What will it take to bring about change?

The Make-or-Break CFO Impact: Assessing CFO candidates in today's market goes far beyond their CV and technical expertise.

Track Record Driving Scale... An elite CFO can be the linchpin accelerating growth or the achilles heel capping your upside value.

In regular recruitment agencies, the fees are low and the consultants get their titles fast, usually within a year. But in executive search firms, it's different. The fees are higher and the consultants take their time, 8 to 10 years, starting as researchers and moving up slowly- the work is strategic and needs a deep understanding of the market and candidate evaluation to deliver great results.  Read more about the “invisibles” of hiring success here https://lnkd.in/dn3EcKMx

Most organizations can rely on their internal teams to fill the majority of their high-demand and critical positions. However, for the remaining 5% of roles that are more challenging to fill, it's crucial to partner with a recruitment agency you trust to deliver results. At FLARE, we pride ourselves on being among the top recruiters, and I’d like to briefly share why we stand out. Success in recruitment, like many aspects of life, comes in varying levels. If you have a staffing need or simply want to have an informal chat about how we can assist, feel free to reach out to me at james@youneedflare.com. Let's connect and explore how we can achieve success together!

New Visa rules are putting politics ahead of growth "Here in London, the move comes as our latest research indicates that half of employers are struggling to fill vacancies. Not only will this adjustment make it harder to hire for many, it will also impact our pipeline of future leaders. Analysis from the Entrepreneurs Network published last summer found that 39% of the UK’s 100 fastest-growing companies had overseas-born founders or co-founders, drawn from 28 countries and five continents. International talent brings fresh perspectives, ideas and ways of working, aiding a cultural dynamism which helps attract 30 million visitors, and £14 billion in tourist spend, to the capital annually." hashtag #TalentShortage, #GlobalTalent, #WorkforceDiversity, #HiringChallenges, h #FutureOfWork, #UKJobs,#LondonJobs, #UKBusiness, #UKEntrepreneurs
