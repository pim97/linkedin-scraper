We had a great time at the VA Immersive Summit! It was fabulous to see all the incredible work being done and to share our platform's applications with the great people from across the country who care for our veterans!

This week, Jude Soundar and I had the incredible opportunity to attend the VA Immersive Summit, hosted by the Veterans Health Administration. It was one of the most engaging conferences I‚Äôve experienced, where attendees could truly SEE the future of healthcare through immersive technology. Here are just a few of the augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) companies making significant strides in clinical innovations to help our veterans: ‚≠êÔ∏è GIGXR is revolutionizing healthcare training with immersive technology using Microsoft‚Äôs #HoloLens. ‚≠êÔ∏è Cabana provides an app that‚Äôs easily accessible to veterans no matter their location, with offerings around daily support for mental health. They also have immersive micro-vacation pods! (Extra brownie points for building their platform on Microsoft #Azure! ‚òÅÔ∏è) ‚≠êÔ∏è Cleanbox Technology offers a fully contained and mobile medical-grade disinfecting device that thoroughly cleans AR/VR headsets (and more!) in just one minute. (Thanks for cleaning my phone Amy!) ‚≠êÔ∏è FireflyVR has developed a experience to enhance the outcomes of mental health therapies. I was especially interested to learn what their doing to help those going through ketamine treatment. ‚≠êÔ∏è Healium tracks your baseline stress levels and leads you through a meditative experience, ensuring you‚Äôre relaxing throughout the process. I felt like I snuck in a mid-day nap after trying it out. ‚≠êÔ∏è HouseCall VR is a patient education platform that helps physicians guide their patients through diagnosis and treatment plans. ‚≠êÔ∏è Magic Horizons offered some visually incredible AR/VR immersions, focused on achieving full relaxation from daily stressors and helping with relaxation during medical treatments. ‚≠êÔ∏è Waya Health offers customizable rehabilitation VR experiences, enabling physicians to analyze patient progress and adjust treatment plans accordingly. ‚≠êÔ∏è and many others I didn‚Äôt have the time to stop and connect with. It was great to hear from Dr. Tamara Campbell, the VHA Executive Director of the Office of Mental Health, on the progress VHA is making in integrated mental health care including work with AR/VR to improve Veterans‚Äô mental health and wellbeing. I was so #immersed in the experience that I forgot to take pictures in the headsets, but I did manage to get one with the VHA Under Secretary, Dr. Shereef Elnahal. A big thank you to Anne, Caitlin, and Evan for having us! Congratulations on the launch of your new VA Immersive Team! We can‚Äôt wait to see how these innovations will continue to benefit our veterans over the next year. #HeadsInHeadsets U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs | XR Association | VR/AR Association (VRARA) | Microsoft David King Lassman | Daniel Schinkel | David Black | Nick Armstrong, PhD | Lorenzo Vallone | Matthew Gravelle | Andy Mathis | Joe Morgan, MD | Linda Ciavarelli, DPM | AG Ciavarelli | Sarah Hill | Karolina Arbova | Giorgio Koppehele | Jonathan Thornhill | Ariane Fikki | Kaitlyn O'Connor | Stephanie Montgomery
